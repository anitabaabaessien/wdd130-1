    <h1>My Favorite City: Accra, Ghana</h1>

    <p>Accra, the dynamic capital of Ghana, pulses with a rich coastal energy on the Gulf of Guinea, blending colonial history with modern vibrancy. As the UNESCO World Book Capital in 2023, it celebrates literature and education through events that promote reading and cultural exchange, making it a haven for storytellers and intellectuals alike. Its streets buzz with markets and music, reflecting the heart of West African resilience.</p>    

    <p>One of my favorite spots is the Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum, a serene park-like memorial to Ghana's independence leader, where visitors can reflect on the nation's journey to freedom since 1957. Economically, Accra thrives as a financial hub with Kotoka International Airport connecting it to the world, driving tourism expected to reach US$8.3 billion by 2027. It's a city that inspires with its blend of history, culture, and opportunity.</p>
